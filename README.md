### SoarBot: A Rule-Based System For Playing Poker

**WARNING! This project is from 2002. Assume that everything's out of date.**

#### SoarSession

SoarSession.tgz is the Java->Tcl->Soar piece. It is not poker-specific and may be useful in other projects. Installation info in readme.txt.

Requirements:

    * Linux
    * Java SDK 1.4.x or later (Very important! 1.3.x is trouble.)
    * Tcl 8.0
    * Soar 8.3

#### SoarBot

SoarBot.tgz is my poker program. Untar it into 1 directory. Installation info in readme.txt. You'll also need my modifications to the Alberta poker framework (explanation in the SoarBot readme.txt).

Requirements:

    * Linux
    * SoarSession
    * A network connection
    * Python (for the startup/shutdown scripts)
